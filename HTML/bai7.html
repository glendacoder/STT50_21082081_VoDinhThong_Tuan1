                    A smile is facial expression formed primarily by flexing the
                    muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes
                    about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction
                    of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as
                    a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye
                    contraction may be perceived as insincere.
